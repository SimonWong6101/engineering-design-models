Congratulations on your interest in Pro/NC-SHEETMETAL.
The release of this new module recognizes the enormous improvement in functionality for sheetmetal manufacturing in Release 20.  This new functionality, AutoNesting specifically, will allow you to compete effectively with specialized CAM packages like MerryMechanizationi, MetalSoft, Anvil and Striker.

The included files will give you a headstart in learning the new module.  Print out the text file TEXT_FOR_TRAINING.  Then step your way throught the exercises.  Included is a directory DEMO, which is filled with all of the training files as well as some other non customer parts for nesting.  

I recommend that you try several examples, and am confident that you will gain insight into the rather simple logic behind the complex functionality.

After you demonstrate the new AutoNesting to a prospective customer, I am confident they will be interested in testing the software upon thier own parts.  Feel confident that any Pro/E sheetmetal part will work well in the nesting algorithm.  The only difficulty you may encounter is in the importation of DXF files.  Unless the files contain only geometry (no dimensions, title blocks, or page borders) the resultant Pro/E part will be incorrect.  If this occurs I recommend you try other parts.  If forced to work with the problem DXF files, however, manually import them into Pro/DETAIL, clean them up, then manually create a Pro/SHEETMETAL-DESIGN part with one flat wall feature.  In the Sketcher mode for this feature, use COPY DRAW to import your clean Pro/DETAIL drawing.  This now native Pro/E part can be include in the Order List for AutoNesting.

Look forward to continued dramatic improvements in Pro/NC-SHEETMETAL.

Best Regards
