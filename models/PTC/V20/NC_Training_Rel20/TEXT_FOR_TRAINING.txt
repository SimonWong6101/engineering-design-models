         Pro/NC-SHEETMETAL AUTOMATION (AutoNesting)




INTRODUCTION


Pro/NC-SHEETMETAL AUTOMATION (AutoNesting) is an advanced part
of Pro/NC-SHEETMETAL module which gives the user the ability to 
create the information necessary to machine sheet metal parts automatically.
In this section you will learn how to create manufacturings automatically 
using defined earlier manufacturings with their NC sequences. You will also
learn the commands associated with Sheet Metal manufacturing which will help
you become efficient in using the module.




THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR AUTOMATION


    -WP automatic creation (setup or retrieve);
          .Width, Length;
          .Thickness;
          .Grain direction;
    -Workcell (set or retrieve):
          .Type & Parameters;
          .Machine Zones & Clamps;
          .Turret - tool definition.
    -Defaults set (set or retrieve):
          .Quantity & Offset;
          .Grain, Flip & Rotation of the parts.
    -Order list:
          .part without NC sequences;
          .part from MFG - with or w/o NC sequences;
          .Cell of Parts - with NC or w/o sequences;
          .DXF file.



EXERCISE   1


1. Change directory to exercise_1.

2. Create a sheetmetal manufactiring named exer_1 and enter AUTOMATION.

3. Change WP size to 36 X 31 with the thickness 0.200; set borders 
   left, top, bottom to 2, right border will be 1; set grain direction to 
   'Unused'.

4. Choose 'DEFAULTS' tab and set the defaults as following:

   Quantity 8    Offset 0.200
   Rotation Angle  Any
   Grain Restriction  Yes
   Flip    Yes
   Select VIEW; FRONT .

5. Now choose 'ORDER' tab; LOAD, PART W/O NC SEQS and select the following parts:
   part_flip_1.prt  part_flip_2.prt ;
   PLACE; OPTIONS; CLUSTER CONTROLS and select 'Yes' option;
   PLACE the parts again; /parts were flipped over/;
   now choose 'SETUP' for the first part in the order list, and system will invoke
   'ELEMENT SETUP' dialog box; switch 'FLIP' to 'no' and switch OFFSET value to 
   'User value' entering 0.000  and do the same operation
   for the NEXT part; OK; and PLACE the parts - you can see that system can not place 
   these parts in closely packed rectangles.
   Now REMOVE  All Parts.

6. Now change default Quantity to 5, and switch off Flip option;
   in the WP size tab change Grain Direction to 'Unused'
   and then LOAD the following parts:
   part_grain_11.prt   part_grain_22.prt
   PLACE these parts;
   in the WP Size tab now change GRAIN DIR to 'X AXIS';PLACE;
   in the WP Size tab now change GRAIN DIR to 'Y AXIS';PLACE;
   now choose 'SETUP' for the first part in the order list, and system will invoke
   'ELEMENT SETUP' dialog box; switch 'GRAIN' to 'no'; OK; PLACE;
   you can see that in this case grain direction was used only for the 
   second part from the 'order list'.
   Now REMOVE  All Parts.

7. Now change default Quantity to 1, and switch on Flip option;
   enter default value for OFFSET 0.200;
   now LOAD list of the parts using FILE, LOAD..., and select the list
   LIST_FOR_EXERC_1; 
   now switch 'CLUSTERING' in OPTIONS to 'no', OK, PLACE these parts;
   you can see that almost all WP area was used to place these parts;
   now switch 'CLUSTERING' in OPTIONS to 'yes', OK, PLACE these parts;
   
8. CLOSE this Window.



 

   
EXERCISE   2



1. Change directory to exercise_2.
 
2. Create a sheetmetal manufactiring named exer_2 and enter AUTOMATION.
 
3. Change the WP SIZE to 40 X 30; thickness will be 0.200;
   Choose OPTIONS, WARNING SELECTION, and switch all options on; OK;
   in DEFAULTS tab set default QUANTITY to 4; set OFFSET to 0.120 .

4. In the ORDER tab LOAD PARTS FROM MFG and select manufacturing
   mfg_flip.mfg;
   system shows this manufacturing in small separate window and asks to select
   what parts from this manufacturing do you want to load - SELECT ALL; OK;
   system warns us about absent tools; lets ADD this PART to the list and
   let's ADD tools to the correspondent workcell turret; OK;
   do the same operation ADD, ADD for the second part of this manufacturing.
   PLACE these 2 parts; in OPTIONS, DISPLAY OPTIONS switch on 'ROUGH POLYGON'
   option, OK; in magenta you will see part's offset.

5. Now load CELL OF PARTS - and select manufacturing mfg_h_tr_2.mfg;OPEN;
   ADD these 2 parts to the list and ADD absent tools to the TURRET;
   go to the WORKCELL tab and select TURRET SHOW - system invokes the dialog box
   'TURRET INFORMATION' and you can see that all tools used in in the loaded
   manufacturing's NC sequences were added to the turret; choose EXIT from the 
   TURRET;

5. In the ORDER tab LOAD PARTS FROM MFG and select manufacturing 
   mfg_multi_3.mfg;
   system shows this manufacturing in small separate window and asks to select
   what parts from this manufacturing do you want to load - SELECT ALL; OK;
   system warns us about incompatible NC sequence type for current loading
   part PART_MULTI_31 but let's try to load
   this part without the incompatible NC sequences; select YES;
   now system warns us about incompatible NC sequence type for current loading
   part PART_MULTI_32; for this part select 'NO';
   you can see that the part PART_MULTI_31 was added to the order list without
   any offset value; also if you will go to the WORKCELL tab and select TURRET
   and SHOW, you can see that there are no additional tools in the turret.

7. Now PLACE the parts; in SETUP for each part from the order list you will see
   that for the first 3 parts from mfg offset value is set 'by Tool' but for 
   the last one it is 'by Default'.


8. Now REMOVE ALL parts/cells from the ORDER LIST.
   
9. In the WORKCELL tab change the Type to Hybrid and TWO OPERATION option;
   now choose TURRET, DEFINE and add your tool to the correspondent turret:
   

         fig_turret

   SHOW this new created tool, then APPLY - and this tool will appear as a row
   in the upper part of the TURRET SETUP dialog box; To save this tool on the disk 
   choose FILE, SAVE TOOL..., and this tool will be saved on the disk. OK;
   This will create a file called 'new_tool.tpm'. Another way to store tool data 
   is to store the manufacturing model - this will store the tool data with the
   seguence in the model, but keep in mind that this does not create a '.tpm' file
   which would allow you to use this tool in another sequence.


10. Choose DEFAULT tab and enter 8 for the part's default quantity.
    Now if we will LOAD PARTS FROM MFG and select mfg_flip.mfg and mfg_multi_3.mfg
    we can select ALL parts from these manufacturings and just ADD all needed 
    tools to the correspondent turret. Place these parts; you will see that all
    loaded parts are with their offset values 'by tool' - you can see it in 
    the SETUP for each part.

11. Now choose VIEW, FRONT.
    In the WORKCELL tab DEFINE  the MACHINE ZONE; system will invoke 'MACHINE
    ZONE' dialog box; CUSTOMIZE zone Width to 6.400; press enter;
    now choose ENABLE button for Automatic Adjusting and select Next To Last option.
    OK; choose one more time MACH. ZONE button and pressing CREATE CLAMP you will 
    see 'MACHINE CLAMP' dialog box. Sketch small rectangle 0.4 X 0.4 as a section
    for the clamp and after that enter 5.4 for the X-OFFSET and 30 for Y-OFFSET.
    

12. Now MAKE MFG  selecting SINGLE SHEET option;12. 

        fig_mfg_ex_2


    Choose CL DATA, OUTPUT, OPERATION, and DONE CL for these 2 operations first
    for punching (first), and then for laser contouring (second operation).


13. Close this window.



   
   



 
EXERCISE  3


1. Change directory to exercise_3.
 
2. Create a sheetmetal manufactiring named exer_3 and enter AUTOMATION

3. Choose FILE, EDITOR, and select the list list_exer_3; OK.
   System invokes SMT MFG FABRICATION EDITOR; (this list you can see also 
   outside PRO/E - WINDOWS, OPEN SYSTEM, and 'cat list_exer_3.dat' -it's the same
   list that one can create outside PRO/E in any text editor; EXIT this window).

4. In the first 'ORDER' tab of the EDITOR we have a possibility to edit any element
   of our order list, copy elements (renaming them or not), delete elements, change
   offset or quantity of the parts etc.
   REMOVE part PART_MULTI_32 from the manufacturing MFG_MULTI_3; 
   Double click on the part PART_MULTI_31 from the manufacturing MFG_MULTI_3 or 
   press EDIT when this element is selected; system invokes ELEMENT EDIT dialog box;
   Change OFFSET value to 'USER VALUE' and enter 0.330; change QUANTITY to 3.
   Select 'NEXT' button and for this part (PART_1) change QUANTITY to 6; OK.

5. Now choose 'USE' to load this list using all (4) items to load; OK.
   PLACE the parts on the workpiece.


              fig_exer_3

   Choose SETUP for the PART_5 from the order list; you can see, that now offset
   is set by default that is zero.
   Now MAKE MFG using SINGLE SHEET option; OK.
   Switch off CSYS display.
 
6. Select MACHINING, DEFINE SEQUENCE, and you will start to define NIBBLE EDGE
   NC sequence; In the TURRET dialog box choose the tool TOOL_NE_ADDED_2, APPLY, OK.
   SHOW MASTER - system shows the first part of selected name that was placed;
   on the master-part od PART_1 select it's external LOOP; DONE; OK.
   DONE/RETURN.

7. Now select FABRICATION and you will redefine this fabricated MFG;
   PLACE the parts; you can see in SETUP for the part PART_1 (with added NC sequence)
   that offset value was changed automatically to 'BY TOOL'; CANCEL from SETUP.
   
8. Close this window.



EXERCISE  4
 
   

1. Change directory to exercise_4.
 
2. Create a sheetmetal manufactiring named exer_4_tr and enter AUTOMATION
 
3. Now LOAD list named LIST_EXER_4 using 3 'LOAD SETUP' options: WP Size, Controls
   and Order List; MAKE this manufacturing using MULTIPLE SHEETS option.

4. In the 'MULTIPLE SMT MFG LIST' you can see that 16 manufacturings were created
   and there are 4 of the same for the first mfg, 4 of the same for the third, and
   7 of the same for the fourth mfg.

5. Choose CL Data, OPERATION, then operation's name, then DONE CL - all predefined
   NC sequences were transfered to this manufacturing.

6. Now select previous manufacturing from the list, choose CL Data, NC SEQUENCE,
   and then select AREA NIBBLING NC sequence that was also transfered for this mfg.
   DONE CL for this NC sequence.

7. Choose now OUTPUT, OPERATION, then operation's name, then DONE CL - all predefined 
   NC sequences were transfered to this manufacturing also.

8.Close this window.
