Pro/ENGINEER Manufacturing Solutions empower manufacturing engineers by encouraging
 their input early in the product-design process, leveraging their expertise 
through up-front involvement.  This communication facilitates design for
manufacturability based on proven practices, available resources, and time 
constraints 
-- improving productivity and enhancing product quality. Through extensive CNC

capabilities -- including milling, hole-making, turning and wire electronic 
discharge machining (WEDM) -- Pro/ENGINEER Manufacturing Solutions provide tools that
 enable a company to <i>reduce time to market and increase profitability.</i><p>

<font size=+1 color=#000080><b>Concurrent Product and Process Development</b>
</font><p>
By leveraging a single database structure and cognitive features, Pro/ENGINEER
Mechanical Design and Manufacturing Solutions enable engineers to implement change
 even late in the product development process, without prolonging time to 
market.  This allows the utilization of in-process work and reduces overall cycle 
times. Plus, a single user interface permits design and manufacturing engineers to
 easily collaborate and leverage one another's knowledge -- reducing manufacturing
lead times and improving productivity.

	"Getting a design concept out of an engineer's head and into a mathematically precise shape is critical.  Pro/ENGINEER's solid modeling helps us to do that quickly." <br>
	--Bill Branan, head of manufacturing technology group, Motorola, United States

</td></tr></table>

<li>Robust, solid-modeling capabilities and parametric features create the best possible
 designs and increase manufacturability from the start of the product development
 process.</li>

<li>Manufacturing processes and deliverables directly reference the design model and
 automatically update when the design changes -- eliminating rework and duplication.
</li>

<li>Changes are communicated to all disciplines through full associativity between 
CAD and CAM.  Automatic updates to all manufacturing deliverables -- including 
process drawings, NC part programs, and inspection instructions -- increase time
savings and maintain design intent.</li>

<li>The single database structure eliminates inconsistencies and data translation, 
and allows engineering information to be leveraged across the entire organization
 -- improving product quality and reducing rework.</li>

<li>A single user interface enables design and manufacturing engineers to easily 
collaborate, reducing manufacturing lead time and improving overall productivity.</li>

Pro/ENGINEER Manufacturing Solutions easily allow the expansion of a single design
 model into a family of products by leveraging "family table" capabilities.  PTC's customers have found that using family tables can provide up to a 90% reduction in development time,
while incorporating and automatically updating NC tool paths for each product rendition.  This enables organizations to respond quickly to target markets worldwide by easily 
expanding product offerings.  To 
further reduce cycle times, scrap and rework while improving quality, manufacuring
 engineers can graphically visualize progressive material removal to 
ensure the accuracy of toolpaths from the start.
<ul>
<li>
Automatically carry out tool path instructions for machining strategies such as 
milling, hole-making, turning, and WEDM -- minimizing costly programming time and
 leveraging proven manufacturing processes.</li>

<li>Incorporate changes, even late in the development process, through the associativity
 between manufacturing features and the design model -- drastically reducing
 time spent completing Engineering Change Orders (ECOs). </li>

<li>Expand product offerings through powerful "family table" programming which
automatically updates toolpaths for each rendition -- eliminating costly reprogramming
 and reusing field-tested engineering data.</li>
<li>Graphically view progressive material removal on screen, giving engineers the 
ability to verify toolpaths prior to cutting metal -- eliminating scrap and lowering
 overall costs.</li>

<li>Leverage a tightly integrated, best-in-class NC post processor which allows machine
 code to be generated seamlessly -- increasing accuracy and maintaining design
 intent.</li>
</ul>

	"Competition in the industries we serve is forcing us to complete production in half the time compared to five years ago.  To meet this challenge, we must be sure that all molded parts are accurate and that we can rapidly make design changes -- capabilities we found readily available within the Pro/ENGINEER Solutions.  Pro/ENGINEER Solutions give us the speed and performance we need to satisfy the time constraints of our customers." <br>
--Dan Schurr, director of CAD/CAM, Buiter Tool & Die, United States

PRO/ENGINEER Manufacturing Solutions offer fully integrated tooling-design functionality
that addresses the specific needs of the tool designer, from core and 
cavity creation to high-quality dies and castings -- improving productivity and 
product quality.
<ul>
<li>Gives plastics engineers easy-to-use tools for creating mold designs, including 
the ability to generate cores and cavities, impression geometry, and complete mold
 assembly documentation -- improving quality and lowering overall costs.</li>


<li>Associatively links fixture and jig designs to the design part -- updating components
 automatically in response to design changes, and ensuring product quality 
and manufacturability.</li>

<li>Creates user-defined libraries of tools, fixtures, features, and manufacturing 
processes and provides access to an abundance of standard tools and fixtures -- 
enhancing productivity and leveraging proven practices.</li>
</ul>
