<font size=4 color="#000080"><b>
<a href="400x400/casting.htm"><img src=

 Pro/CASTING 
</font></b><p>
The high quality, close-tolerance dies and castings required by today's 
manufacturing industries are created quickly and easily with Pro/CASTING. 
Pro/CASTING's parametric, feature-based architecture permits numerous iterations 
of the tooling design early in the product-development process to optimize casting 
geometry, die cavities, and cores. As changes are made anywhere in the process, all 
deliverables update automatically -- resulting in faster time to market, lower 
development costs, and higher quality parts.

<TITLE>Products and Solutions: Pro/CMM  </TITLE>

<a href="400x400/cmm.htm"><img src=

 Pro/CMM
</font></b><p>
Pro/CMM is used by Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) programmers to create 
inspection programs from Pro/ENGINEER design models. Using a graphical 
programming interface tightly integrated with Pro/ENGINEER, features can be 
measured by defining probe locations, feature tolerance information can be 
accessed directly from the Pro/ENGINEER model, and automatic collision detection is 
provided to ensure that expensive probe tooling clears the manufacturing assembly. 
With Pro/CMM, programmers can efficiently develop programs off-line from the 
CMM, ensuring a correct inspection program the first time around.

<TITLE>Products and Solutions: Pro/MFG  </TITLE>
<font size=4 color="#000080"><b>
<a href="400x400/mfg.htm"><img src=
"images/small/mfg.gif" border=0 align=right></a>
 Pro/MFG
</font></b><p>
Pro/MFG is a set of CAM solutions to generate highly efficient, production quality 
CNC tool paths. Capable of programming 2- through 5-axis milling, 2- through 
5-axis turning with live tooling, 2- and 4-axis wire EDM, and 2-axis contourng, 
Pro/MFG uses the highly accurate and precise solid model developed in 
Pro/ENGINEER as a reference for developing NC tool paths. Integration with the 
Pro/ENGINEER product line allows programmers to design fixtures and to create 
setup and operation sheets. Pro/MFG's breadth of automated machining strategies 
makes it ideal for the mold making, automotive, aerospace, casting, and medical 
industries, or any shop with requirements for machining 2-D and 3D components.

<TITLE>Products and Solutions: Pro/MOLDESIGN  </TITLE>

 Pro/MOLDESIGN
</font></b><p>
Pro/MOLDESIGN provides solutions for the design and manufacture of tooling for 
plastic molded parts -- including design, assembly, analysis, and documentation. 
As development teams work concurrently to develop the product and tool design, all 
deliverables and procedures update automatically reducing product costs, and 
overall time to market. Pro/MOLDESIGN's integration with third-party plastic flow 
analysis packages allows shops to analyze and optimize flow characteristics before 
cutting any steel. Multiple iterations of the design also result in a higher quality, 
incorporating the best principles of design-for-manufacturing.<br>
For Release 18.0, shrinkage documentation enhancements allow users to show either a percent of
shrinkage or final shrinkage-compensated dimensions.  User productivity enhancements include check-mark blanking of
Pro/MOLDESIGN surfaces and volumes.  Mold based libraries have been enhanced by leveraging Pro/ENGINEER&reg; 
simplified representation technology and offer three distinct levels of complexity, which include fully
detailed models, simplified representations, and datum curves to indicate mold base boundaries.  The mold
section of Pro/LIBRARY<font size=1>TM</font> will contain mold-specific geometry such as
sprue, runner, and gate UDFs.

<TITLE>Products and Solutions: Pro/NC-CHECK  </TITLE>
<font size=4 color="#000080"><b>
<a href="400x400/nc_check.htm"><img src=
"images/small/nccheck.gif" border=0 align=right></a>
 Pro/NC-CHECK
</font></b><p>
Pro/NC-CHECK provides NC programmers with on-screen graphical simulation of 
CNC tool paths generated by Pro/MFG. The ability to visually verify an NC tool path 
enables the user to detect interferences and prove-out each aspect of cutting a part 
before valuable machine and operator time are committed. Multiple tool path 
iterations can then be quickly and easily explored -- and results immediately 
verified -- all within the Pro/ENGINEER environment. Integrated with Pro/MFG, no 
data translation is necessary to validate NC tool paths.<p>

<TITLE>Products and Solutions: Pro/NC-POST  </TITLE>
<font size=4 color="#000080"><b>
<a href="400x400/nc_post.htm"><img src=
"images/small/ncpost.gif" border=0 align=right></a>
 Pro/NC-POST
</font></b><p>
Pro/NCPOST is an easy-to-use development environment that generates NC 
post-processors for any type of CNC machine, lowering NC post-processor 
development and maintenance costs. Pro/NCPOST uses a comprehensive, 
tree-structured questionnaire managed by an expert system to interactively 
describe a specific machine/control combination for each post-processor to be 
created. Pro/NCPOST is integrated with Pro/MFG to offer seamless conversion of 
cutter location data files to G and M codes

 <img src="/common/images/new_mod.gif" hspace=5 align=left>Pro/PROCESS for MFG
</font></b><p>

Pro/PROCESS for MFG provides tools to generate step-by-step instructions describing the processes required to manufacture parts.  Production-ready plans can be created including machining and non-machining steps, time/cost estimates, and graphical documentation of the manufacturing assembly, for release to the shop floor.  And Pro/PROCESS for MFG's fully associative, parametric capabilities enable true concurrent development by allowing you to make changes to the product design and automatically update the process plan - significantly reducing our company's design-to-manufacturing cycle times.<p>

<TITLE>Products and Solutions: Pro/SHEETMETAL  </TITLE>
<font size=4 color="#000080"><b>
<a href="400x400/sheetmetal.htm"><img src=
"images/small/sheetmetal.gif" border=0 align=right></a>
 <img src="/common/images/enhanced.gif" hspace=5 align=left>Pro/SHEETMETAL
</font></b><p>
Pro/SHEETMETAL provides designers with specialized tools for the design and manufacture of sheet metal parts.
These specialized design features include punches, notches, and forms, to capture manufacturing information in 
parametric 3-D models.  The models can be automatically flattened and used to generate CNC programs, providing stock utilization
and machine time utilization.<br>
With Release 18.0, Pro/SHEETMETAL users now have the ability to create standard sheet metal sections and merge
them into a single part.  Tule-checking capability allows designers to check parts against company guidelines
that govern the location and size of cuts, bends, and walls.  These additons will enhance users' ability
to reuse geometry, automate repetitive tasks, and simplify the design process, while delivering better, more 
manufacturable parts, shortening the overall product development cycle.

<TITLE>Products and Solutions: Pro/VERIFY  </TITLE>

<a href="400x400/verify.htm"><img src=
"images/small/verify.gif" border=0 align=right></a>
 Pro/VERIFY
</font></b><p>

Pro/VERIFY is a powerful analysis tool for comparing data gathered by an 
automated inspection machine, such as a laser scanner, to the Pro/ENGINEER solid 
model. Pro/VERIFY enables manufacturers to inspect parts produced in-house or by 
a supplier, by automatically comparing scanned point-cloud data to the 
Pro/ENGINEER model. This provides a highly accurate comparison of physical parts 
to theoretical design, resulting in reduced inspection time and 
design-to-manufacturing cycles for your company.
