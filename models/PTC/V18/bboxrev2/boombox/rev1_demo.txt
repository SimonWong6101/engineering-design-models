^! The naming convenvention shown here for layers provides
^! a way to organize your layers in a specific order.  Pro
^! sorts layers in alphanumeric order.  As new layers are
^! created, they will be added to the bottom of the list if
^! they begin with an "alpha" character.  They will be added
^! to the top of the list if they begin with "0_".  In addition,
^! if you want to add new layers for a group of items, you can
^! make them appear as indented layers.  For example:
^!
^!			1_ALL_PLANES
^!			1___DEF_PLANES
^!			1___ANG_PLANE
^!			2_ALL_CSYS
^!			2___DEF_CSYS
^!			3_ALL_AXES
^!			3___HOLE_AXES
^!
^!DEF_LAYER LAYER_DATUM 		1_ALL_PLANES

^!DEF_LAYER LAYER_AXIS 		3_ALL_AXES 
^!DEF_LAYER LAYER_POINT 		4_ALL_POINTS 
^!DEF_LAYER LAYER_CURVE 		5_ALL_CURVES
