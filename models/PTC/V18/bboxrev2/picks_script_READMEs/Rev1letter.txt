To Recipients of the Boombox demo, Rev 1:

Enclosed is a tape of the new demo.  Although full quality testing 
has not been done, it should be workable.  

DO NOT USE THE FILES PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE ON PRO/E CD's.  

Get all your comments whether on the flow, the message, picks, whatever 
to me for the short term.  I think that customer support will eventually 
be handling bugs and quality issues on the demo, but this is not finalized.

You will notice that the html stuff does not match the script all that well.
This will be addressed soon.  We are delivering quite a different message 
than in past demos so take time to prepare your talk and work on timing.
The demo in it's entirety is rather long.  You should eliminate sections 
which don't add value based on the time you have to perform the demo and 
your knowledge of the customer.

Please let me know about any deals we close as a result of this demo.
(1 DEMO DEALS)  

Wouldn't it be nice to close some business off a demo 
rather that doing a full process audit and event day for every customer?

Good Luck,
