The following HTML docs should be run on Netscape 3.0 or higher.  For the AUTOPLAY section for the intro, this should be run off your hard-drive (not CD-ROM) for maximum performance.

The following Netscape proportional font settings (found in the General
Preferences area of Netscape) are recommended for optimimum viewing of
the introduction and summary HTML pages:

DEC Unix and SGI:  Use default Netscape setting of the Proportional
font.  This is Times (Adobe), Size 12, No Scaling

SUN and HP:  Set Proportional font to Times (Adobe), Size 18, No
Scaling.

Windows NT:  Ensure display size is 1280 x 1024.  Use standard settings
for the Proportional font (Times (Adobe), Size 12, No Scaling).

It is recommended that the Directory Buttons, Location, and Toolbar be
turned off in the browser.

The following four pages should be bookmarked:

index.htm
options.htm
intralink.htm
laser.htm

Please add any other considerations for the Pro/WEB-PUBLISH portion of
the demo, as appropriate.
