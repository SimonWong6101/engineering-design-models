Talking points for applications protocols during openhouse

REMEMBER YOU HAVE ONLY THREE MINUTES

- An application protocol is (mainly) a selection of data types from
  among all the types provided by STEP/PDES, for doing a particular set of
  tasks.

- One important application is manufacturing by machining.
  Refer to poster showing five steps.
  All the players must agree on what data they are going to deal with.

- Design information is common to all.  They may agree to represent
  design information using geometry and topology.
  Show picture of flange.

- The process planner may want to extract machinable features from the
  design.
  Show features picture.
  The process planner produces a list of instructions for how to machine
  the part.
  Show plan.

- The NC-programmer takes the design and process plan (and other information)
  and produces an NC-program.
  Show program and tool path.
