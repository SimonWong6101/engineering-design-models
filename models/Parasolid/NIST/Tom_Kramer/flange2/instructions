HOW TO USE A SUN TO DISPLAY PICTURES FOR TALKING ABOUT
APPLICATION PROTOCOLS

There are four pictures which may easily be displayed in order:
  1. Wire frame of flange
  2. Features view of flange
  3. Process plan for machining flange
  4. NC program and view of the flange with tool path.

A. Log in as kramer.

B. Type in:  demo<CR>  This will bring up a window system.

C. Put cursor in window at lower right of screen.

D. Type in:  demo<CR>
   This will display the first picture.
   Be sure the cursor stays in the lower right of the screen.

E. To go to the next picture, type in:  <CR>
   Sometimes the next picture appears within two seconds, and sometimes
   it takes 15 seconds.  I suspect the amount of time depends upon how
   heavily the broad band is being used.

F. After all four pictures have been displayed, you can display them
   again by going back to step D.
