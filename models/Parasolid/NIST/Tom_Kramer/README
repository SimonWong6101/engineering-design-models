This directory contains files associated with specific parts.

Each part is in a subdirectory.

Within a subdirectory the file names consist of a prefix which identifies
what kind of file it is and a suffix which identifies the format.

If there are different versions of the same thing, the version number
is inserted immediately after the prefix.

Meanings are as follows:

Prefix (what kind of file)
--------------------------
brep-design       = design in boundary representation format
brep-fixture      = fixture in boundary representation format
brep-workpiece    = workpiece in boundary representation format
mvsev             = a set of material removal shape element volumes
features-design   = design in features format


Suffix (what format)
-------------------------
amrf              = amrf format (usually for a brep-design)
olps              = common-lisp readable format used by OLPS
step              = PDES/STEP physical file format
step-comp         = PDES/STEP physical file format following compression
                       by substituting references for embedded entities,
                       deleting duplicate entities, etc.
step-long         = PDES/STEP physical file format following expansion
                       by substituting embedded entities for all references
vws               = franz-lisp readable format used by VWS2 system




Examples
-------
1. In the mrsev1 directory, "brep-design.step" is a boundary representation
design file in PDES/STEP format.

2. In the pipe directory, "brep-workpiece.olps" is a boundary representation
file describing a workpiece in the common-lisp readable format used by OLPS.
