Steve -

There is a shortcoming in release 3 of Parasolid where the surface created
by blending a circular edge between a cone and a plane is a blend surface
rather than a torus. I am curious whether this has been fixed in Release
4.0.

If you start up KID and run the following, the surface type of the
surface which makes the blend will be printed out.

If you have a minute to run it, I would be curious to know what you get.
Thanks.
