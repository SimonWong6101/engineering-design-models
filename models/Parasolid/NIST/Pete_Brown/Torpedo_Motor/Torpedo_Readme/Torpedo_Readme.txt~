This directory contains Microstation Modeler & Acis models for the

Each part has a Postscript file as well, same filename but with a .ps
extension.

*  I used these part because both ACIS and Microstation failed when I
tried to use the versions with the blends.  Have not had time to
further investigate this.

The first person or group that can automatically recognize all of the
features on this part, and generate a process plan wins a steak dinner
