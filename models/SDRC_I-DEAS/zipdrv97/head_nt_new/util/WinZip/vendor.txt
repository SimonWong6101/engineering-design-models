                         Suggested Description

WinZip brings the convenience of Windows to the use of Zip files and
other compression formats.  Windows 95, NT, and Windows 3.1 versions are
shipped on the same disk.  WinZip features include:

Windows 95 support:  WinZip includes long filename support and tight
integration with the Windows 95 shell.  Drag and drop to or from the
Explorer, or zip and unzip without leaving the Explorer.

Internet support:  WinZip features built-in support for popular Internet
file formats:  TAR, gzip, and Unix compress.  ARJ, LZH, and ARC files
are supported via external programs.  WinZip interfaces to most virus
scanners.

The WinZip Wizard:  this optional feature uses the standard and
familiar "wizard" interface to simplify the process of unzipping and
installing software distributed in Zip files. The WinZip Wizard is not
targeted at experienced users, but is ideal for the rapidly growing
number of PC users getting started with Zip files.  When these users
gain confidence or want to use more advanced zipping features, the full
WinZip Classic interface is just a click away.

                              Requirements

The 32-bit version requires Windows 95 or Windows NT.  The 16-bit
version requires Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups.  No other
programs are are required for basic ZIP operations.  Optional features
require external programs, including the shareware PKZIP/PKUNZIP product
from PKWARE, Inc. or ARJ from Robert Jung or LHA.EXE from Haruyasu
Yoshizaki.  WinZip interfaces to several programs to access ARC files
and optionally runs most virus scanning utilities, including
Windows-based virus scanners.

                           Registration
