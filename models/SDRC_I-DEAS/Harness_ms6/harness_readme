The following global symbols are defined and are available for use in the presentation:

ADD	Autoscales preselected dimensions		
ADO	Toggles the autodraw switch
ARR	Flips the arrow on preselected dimensions
CFF	Changes the font and color of preselected curves
CLL	Toggles centerline/centerpoint visibility	
CVV	Toggles constraint visibility
EHH	Hides preselected entities
ETT	performs an orient, move
LLL	Places the leader off of the left side of the dimension
LOO	Toggles the visibility of local origins
LRR	Places the leader off of the right side of the dimension
VVC	Sets the dynamic rotation center to a user picked point
CSS	Toggles the visibility of reference designators (coordinate

NOTES:

1. The formatted wire list file "wire_1ist.txt" (yes that is a "one" not an "l") is placed on the drawing rather than the one actually written.  The formatting makes the file more readable.
