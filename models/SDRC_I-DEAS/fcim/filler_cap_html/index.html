This demo has been created to allow you to show <font color=red>
Associative Copy</font> in a Team environment. It uses the concept of the tool
maker working concurrently as the design evolves. The demo also make use of the 
new MS5 functions of <font color=red> Split and Offset Surface.</font>
<p>
The demo was designed and documented with the thought that it 
would be shown as a double headed demo, as this really gets the point across 
to the audience. But the data can just as easily be used by a single user.
<p>
The part to be molded has an internal thread, and the exterior has a series 
of grooves so a cavity insert could not be rotated.  Thus the tool has been 
designed to be gated through the core with a hot runner system.  The actual
tool has 4 cavities all driven by the center gear and idlers, but to make the
CWA process more clear these have been ommited.
