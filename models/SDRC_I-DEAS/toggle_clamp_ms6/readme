Installation instructions for the Toggle Clamp Demo

1) cd to "../toggle_clamp" directory

2) Start ideas and create a new project called "Toggle Clamp"

3) Exit ideas

4) Run the "adopt_std_pivot_pin.scr" shell script.  This starts ideas using
the x3d driver, runs a program file called "adopt_std_pivot_pin.prg".
This program file does the following :-
      (a) creates a new catalog called "Standard Parts Catalog", 
      (b) adopts a catalog part file ("Formed_Pivot_Pin_Original.sprt")
          in to that catalog,
      (c) adopts formatted picture file ("Formed_Pivot_Pin_Original.pff"),
      (d) creates a relationship where the catalog part depends on the 
          picture file. This enables the preview button on the Parts
          catalog form.

1) Ensure ws1 and ws2 has a copy of the "toggle_clamp" directory.

2) Both users must start ideas from this directory to have access to the
