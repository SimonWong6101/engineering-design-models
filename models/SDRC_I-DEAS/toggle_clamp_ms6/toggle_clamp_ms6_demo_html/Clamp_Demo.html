Stage (2)	Builds solid Handle part.
Designs grip.



¥    Begin in the Design Application under the Master Modeler Task.


¥	Export the 2 views required as wireframe in the same file.

File  ->  Export  ->  To Solids  ->  "handle_sects"  ->  Wireframe


 

¥	Exit Drafting and Un-iconise the Master Modeler session.


Global symbol wrr
This runs a program file (read_handle_views.prg).  The program file 
does the following
Reads the new sections that were exported from Drafting
Gets them to the workbench.
Renames them to Handle_View_1 and Handle_View_2



¥	Extrude Handle_View_1 geometry

 
Extrude   Handle_View_1 (simpler shape)  ->  Distance 16 (Can be 
measured from Handle_View_2 geometry).

 	 


¥	Extrude Handle_View_2 geometry and Intersect with Handle_View_1 
extrusion.

 
Extrude   Handle_View_2  ->  Thicken ->  Intersect

 

 

Pick the Handle_View_1 extrusion


 	 
 
¥	Change the part color to Gray 80 80 80


Double-Click a part edge  ->  Color  ->  Gray 80 80 80 


 
¥	Rename the part on the screen to be Handle



Create the Handle Grip

 
¥	Change to the Front View 

 
¥	Start line at point 1  ->  focus on center point 2  ->  finish line at point 3

 


 
¥	Ground curve end at point 2

 
¥	Arc centered on the vertical line  ->  Finished on line.


 
¥	Trim the vertical line back to meet the arc (not the arc end)

¥	Move the arc dimension to a location outside of the arc
 

 
¥	Create a spline from the arc end  ->  approx. 4 mid points  ->  to line end
(Note:-  Spline constraint options are OFF)

 


¥	Change task to Master Surfacing

    ---->    
¥	Match the curvature to the arc
Pick arc  ->  pick spline
 

 
¥	Use Drag to change the arc radius  ->  the spline to suit
(PLAY WITH IT)
 	 


 
¥	Revolve the section around the vertical line  ->  360 deg  ->  Protrude  -
>  Pick the Handle part

 

 
Putaway the Handle

¥	Delete the remaing point on the workbench

Animate.
Change the Link length and then back.


 
¥	Get the Clamp Sketch part to the workbench.

 
¥	Drag the red angular dimension called Driving_Angle
(Do Not Change the Value)

 


 
¥	Animate the Driving_Angle between 15  ->  85 degrees,  speed approx.  
20


 
¥	Modify yellow Link_Length dimension  ->  45


 
¥	Animate the Driving_Angle between 15  ->  85 degrees,  speed approx.
