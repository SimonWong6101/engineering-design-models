block jaw h .7 w 6.1 d .7
move jaw -3.25 -.35 0
frustum taper h 7 maj .6 min .9 top 0
move taper 0 0 3.6
rotate taper by -90 about y
intersect taper with jaw  

cyl center h .7 r .5
unite center with jaw

torus handle maj 8 min .45
move handle 6.6 -6 0
block b h 9 w 9 d 9
move b 4.5 4.6 0
intersect b with handle

block b h .7 w 1.6 d .6
move b 1 .4 0
unite b with handle
unite handle with jaw

copy jaw as jaw2
rotate jaw2 by 180 about x
rotate jaw by 1 about z
rotate jaw2 by -1 about z
unite jaw2 with jaw as pliers

move pliers 6.3 0 0
rotate pliers by -90 about y
rotate pliers by 90 about z
save pliers to needle-nose.sat

block b h 1 w 1 d 1
subtract b from pliers
save pliers to needle-nose-use.sat
